Overview
In this assignment, you will get to create a GUI application that uses classes and objects. 

Guidelines
Option 1:

Create a GUI application of a theme of your choice that uses at least 1 class with 5 properties and 2 methods. Create at least 1 object and display the properties on the form to demonstrate that your class works. Design the GUI so that users will be able to input the values that correspond to the class. Created objects should be displayed on the GUI. 

Option 2:

Create a GUI application where you define a class that will help track cave exploration. Think about things that you would want to know about caves - name, location, depth, exploration status, etc. and use those as the properties. Design the GUI so that users will be able to input the values that correspond to the class. Created objects should be displayed on the GUI. 

Expectations
Create 1 class.
The class should have at least 5 properties.
The class should have at least 2 methods.
Set up inputs on the GUI that correspond to the properties.
Allow the user to create multiple objects based on the class you created. In your demo, create at least 5 objects.
Display the objects that the user has created on the GUI.
Over-comment the code to show your understanding of C# and the intent of your application.
Name your variables using best naming practices.
Make improvements to your UI. Your application must have a great UX and provide the user with more than enough information they will need to use your application without help.
Test your application with techniques learned in the course.
Deliverables / Submission 
Video of your work demonstrating all functionality of this assignment, along with a brief code review.
Submit the zipped project folders and files (include the solution file) to GitHub and provide the link to the repo in Canvas.
Projects that significantly exceed the requirements will need prior approval from the instructor and may require a code review to receive credit.
